üì∞ Fake or Real News Detection
Detect whether a news article is Fake or Real using supervised machine learning algorithms. This project demonstrates the application of text preprocessing, feature extraction with TF-IDF, and classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), with detailed evaluation.

üöÄ Overview
Fake news has become one of the major challenges in digital media. In this project, I used natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to detect whether a piece of news is real or fake based on its content.

The project uses a labeled dataset of real and fake news articles and applies:
